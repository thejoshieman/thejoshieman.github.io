  <h2>Who is The Joshie Man?</h2>
  <p>Joshie-man is a ten-year-old who is Autistic and non-speaking.</p>
  <p>
    He loves going on long walks, especially with his family, being outdoors,
    and dancing. He is a little human being, just like you and me, and he
    understands everything being said around and about him even when he has
    limited to no speech. When he is happy or excited, he jumps and clapsâ€”a lot.
    Because Joshie-man is full of wonder, joy, and innocence, he is always
    excited to see his favorite food and drink served at the restaurant table.
    When he is feeling overwhelmed, he will flap his hands and put them over his
    face. They are actions that make Joshie feel more comfortable and able to
    cope, and they can help focus his mind.
