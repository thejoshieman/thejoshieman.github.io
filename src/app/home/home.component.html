        Joshie-man is a ten-year-old who is Autistic and non-speaking. He loves
        going on long walks, especially with his family, being outdoors, and
        dancing. He is a little human being, just like you and me, and he
        understands everything being said around and about him even when he has
        limited to no speech.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he's happy or excited, he jumps and clapsâ€”a lot. Because Joshie-man
        is full of wonder, joy, and innocence, he is always excited to see his
        favorite food and drink served at the restaurant table. When he's
        feeling overwhelmed, he'll flap his hands and put them over his face.
        They're actions that make Joshie feel more comfortable and able to cope,
        and they can help focus his mind.
