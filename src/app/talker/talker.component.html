    The Joshie-man uses an amazing piece of technology (proloquo2go) on his ipad
    which we call his "talker". It gives him a voice and allows him to
    communicate his wants, desires and feelings.

        At school, he had a task to identify and name various vegetables, one of
        which was brussels sprouts. He knew exactly what he wanted to “say”, but
        the tools were not there for him. So he sat, he thought for a second and
        quickly solved this problem. He actually wrote out “I see small
        cabbage”.
